###### When you arrive:

- Check in at the DYOS station at the front desk of Studio M. They will confirm you're registered and collect payment or confirm your sponsorship is active.
- If masks are required and you do not have one, a mask can be purchased from the front desk for:
  - $1 cash or Zelle
  - $2 Venmo or PayPal (pricing difference due to transaction fees)
- Just past the entrance, there's a station to optionally grab the following:
  - **Name tags**: You can write your preferred name, pronouns, and have the option of adding a mask sticker to your nametag if you wish for others to keep a mask on when dancing with you.
  - **Color-coded wristbands**: These indicate your preferred role(s) in the dance.
  - **Pride stickers**: We are a 2SLGBTQIA+ affirming space and welcome the opportunity to express our pride!
  - **Mints**: You may be dancing in close proximity to others, so be considerate of your hygiene.
- Proceed to your selected DYOS class/event. Please note the studio has multiple rooms and DYOS shares this space with other non-DYOS dancers. If you are unsure where to go, check with the front desk and they can point you in the right direction.
