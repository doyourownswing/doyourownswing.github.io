        national origin, sexual orientation, or disability are not permitted in 
        any Do Your Own Swing related spaces, including in-person events or online 
        spaces. Derogatory remarks or gestures are grounds for corrective action 
        (see below).`,
      `Violence and harm in the form of unwanted physical touch, derogatory remarks 
        or gestures, verbal harassment, or “microaggressions” are grounds for 
        corrective action (see below). `,
      `The categorization of an act as violent or harmful is determined by those 
        experiencing or witnessing the violence or harm, not the person(s) accused 
        of violence or harm.`,
      `If you are approached and informed that your words, actions, and/or behaviors 
        have caused harm, you have the option to either believe the impact of your 
        behaviors and engage in corrective actions or to be banned from Do Your Own 
        Swing events. Denying the impact of your actions and/or refusing responsibility 
        for the impact of your actions will prevent the possibility of corrective 
        experiences and will result in a ban from Do Your Own Swing events. `,

      `Be mindful when taking pictures and filming. Only film those who have given 
        direct verbal consent. Part of being a safe space for TNBGE (Trans, 
        Non-Binary, Gender Expansive) people (as well as being a safe space for 
        anyone) is allowing people to experiment with their self presentation 
        and personal expression without documentation of it belonging to others 
        or being posted to the internet without consent. Get direct verbal consent 
        before taking pictures or filming at DYOS and be mindful of the way the 
        mirrors can capture those who have not consented to documentation of their 
        image or movement being owned by anyone else. We do not require people to 
        sign an image release for participation in DYOS events, so please do not 
        post images or videos to the internet unless the people who could be 
        recognized in the images or videos have given their consent. `,
      `All social agreements are ongoing. Agreements to dance, converse, or engage 
        with any activity do not override a person's present-time comfort levels. 
        Social activities, such as dancing and conversing, may be concluded by any 
        person at any time without explanation. `,
      `To the best of your ability, hold yourself and others in kindness. In the 
        absence of a safety issue, be curious and seek to find the distance from 
        a person that allows you to hold both them and yourself in kind regard. 
        If safety *is* an issue, please do what is needed to stay safe and consider 
        reporting/seeking support.`,
      `While dance is the activity / interest that brings us together, many people
        use DYOS primarily as a community gathering space, especially if they are 
        injured or mostly in need of community connection. A “no” is a complete answer 
        to any request, including a request for a dance. `,
      `Participants are encouraged to exercise their “no.” If, in addition to your no, 
        you choose to share a reason, that is a kindness, but not a requirement. `,
      `Honor your energy. If your needs are met and you have the energy to offer warmth 
        to others, please do so. This can look like acknowledging or thanking someone, 
        letting people know that you are happy to see them, or whatever warmth and 
        outreach look like for you!`,
      `Prioritize remembering names and pronouns. If you use the wrong name or pronouns, 
        or are corrected, quickly correct yourself and continue with what you were saying 
        and make an effort to use the correct name and pronouns in the future.`,

        health-related topics. Try offering an affirmation about someone's choices and
