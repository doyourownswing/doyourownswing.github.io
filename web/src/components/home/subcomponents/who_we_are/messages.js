  Do Your Own Swing strives to create a community not only of amazing west coast swing dancers, but 
  one that makes everyone feel included and safe. While we focus on developing and refinining our dance skills,
  our community is built on a foundation of ensuring all members of the community can freely express
  who they are. We especially welcome those who are health and COVID-conscious and want to mask, and those
  who identify as 2SLGBTQIA+.
